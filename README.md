# Oscars_data
This repo contains an analysis of Oscars winners
## The scope of this project is to show the changes among Oscars winners. I tried to analyze the gender, age, find any corelations and try to find the actors that won more that 1 oscar, finally to show two actors among women and men with the most Oscars in their hands.

## #1 Loading data
Used pandas to read csv file
## #2 Slicing and statistics
Used slicing of DataFrame and find some statistical relations among selected groups ( median and age ). Then show distribution of the statistical data.
## #3 Find actress before 1950 with age more than 40
As analysis said there was only 1 acress with the age>40 before 1950 and we decided to find her. Using simple slicing (now i would do that by query function I think).
## #4 More than 1 Oscar
I decided to find the men and women who won more than 1 Oscar using pandas selections. At the end I found the most awarded people.
## #5 Analysis
Last thing is commented analysis of the results
